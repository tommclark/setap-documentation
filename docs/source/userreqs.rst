User Requirements
=====

After conducting surverys and collecting data from potential users, we identified these requiurements as the most important for the event app:

* Ensuring a transparent and easily understandable process for customers to request refunds, specifying clear conditions under which refunds are applicable, and establishing a timely and efficient refund processing system to enhance customer satisfaction.

* A location-based feature that displays a comprehensive list of local events, and provides users with the ability to apply intuitive filters, such as date, category, or venue, to refine and personalise their event search for a more tailored and relevant experience.

* Enabling a notification system that informs users about scheduled or booked events in a timely manner, allowing users to customise notification preferences based on factors like lead time, event type, or specific alerts

* A system that assigns seats in a sequential order corresponding to the purchase time, ensuring fairness and transparency in seat distribution. This includes designing a mechanism that efficiently manages and updates seat availability in real-time, providing users with a clear understanding of their assigned seats based on their ticket purchase order within the event venue.

* Establishing a notification system that keeps users informed about their events. This involves sending timely updates, including event reminders, changes in schedule, and any relevant information, through various communication channels such as email, push notifications, or SMS.

* Robust measures to ensure that no credit card details or other sensitive information is collected during the sign-up process. This includes designing a secure authentication system that only requests essential information for account creation, excluding sensitive financial data.

* Provide comprehensive and organised information about events. This includes implementing a structured layout with key details such as event name, date, time, venue, and description prominently displayed. Visual elements such as images or maps can be incorporated to enhance clarity.

* Intuitive and user-friendly interface. This includes employing a clean and organised design with well-defined navigation menus, icons, and labelling. Consistent placement of common features and actions contributes to a seamless user experience. Implementing responsive design principles ensures accessibility across various devices. The goal is to minimise complexity, streamline interactions, and provide users with a straightforward and enjoyable interface that requires minimal effort to understand and navigate.

* Optimising performance to ensure swift and responsive interactions with the system. This involves efficient coding practices, minimising unnecessary processes, and optimising data retrieval and rendering. Prioritising a lightweight design and optimising images and multimedia content contributes to faster app loading times.
