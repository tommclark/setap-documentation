Elements of Implementation
==================

Technologies used
-----------------
The app has been programmed using the Dart and Flutter programming languages. Flutter is a modern and versatile framework for building many different types of apps or programs. It is a cross-platform framework, meaning that it can be used to build apps for both Android and iOS devices, as well as for web-based applications. Our event app is a web-based application, so it can be run in a web browser on any device.

Dart is the programming language that is used to write Flutter apps. It is a modern language that is easy to learn and use, and it is designed to work well with Flutter. It has many similarities to other popular programming languages, particularly Java, which makes it easy for developers to pick up and learn quickly. This was particularly useful for this project as the developers in our team had encountered Dart before, so we were able to enhance our knowledge of the language and apply it successfully to make the event app fully functional and user-friendly.
